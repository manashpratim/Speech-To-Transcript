# Speech-To-Transcript
# Description

Designed and trained end-to-end character level speech to transcript generator using an encoder-decoder network consisting of CNNs and pyramidal bidirectional LSTMs based encoder, attention-based LSTM decoder, teacher-forcing and gumble noise. 
Decoded the sequences using greedy decoding, random decoding and beam search.
Achieved a Levenshtein distance of 11.43 on the test set, beating the A cutoff of 12. 

**Note: This project is part of my Homeworks. Current CMU students please refrain from going through the codes.**
